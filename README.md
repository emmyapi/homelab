In this repo I will be documenting my setup 

Resources for stuff I need to do: 
- Split a GPU between multiple LXCs in Proxmox: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZDr5h52OOE
- I need an extra GPU for my jellyfin/servarr VM
  - Or I need to run jellyfin/servarr in LXCs
  - Or I need another PC to run other services that need a GPU
- Tailscale: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPdvyR7bLqI
